# AxiomTrace RULES.md

> Version: v1.0 | Status: **Enforced** | Update Date: 2026-04-29

---

## 1. Project Purpose (Unshakeable)

AxiomTrace is an **MCU Bare-metal Observability Microkernel**. Our firm goals:

- **Easy to Use**: Developers can log their first structured event within 5 minutes. APIs have clear semantics, intuitive naming, and complete documentation.
- **Lightweight & Efficient**: Hot path O(1), no malloc, no printf, no blocking, ISR-writable. Minimum configuration: Flash < 4KB, RAM < 2KB.
- **Extensibility**: Pluggable Backends, extensible Payload types, prunable Profiles, forward-compatible protocol. Adding a backend does not modify the Core.
- **User Friendly**: Zero-config start, single-file library for quick entry, progressive APIs (from hardcoded IDs to X-Macros to YAML). Clear error messages and examples covering all scenarios.
- **Trusted & Releasable**: Frozen protocol, verifiable toolchain, regression-ready golden tests, traceable faults.

**What it is NOT**:
- Not a printf replacement.
- Not an RTOS/Linux logging library.
- Not a full filesystem.
- Not a chip HAL encapsulation library.

## 2. Hot Path Iron Rules (Prohibitions)

The following behaviors are **strictly prohibited** in `axiom_write()` and all ISR call paths:

| Prohibition | Reason | Consequence of Violation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `malloc` / `free` | Non-deterministic heap allocation, potential blocking, fragmentation. | Rejection of PR. |
| `printf` / `sprintf` / `vsnprintf` | Large code size, high stack consumption, non-deterministic. | Rejection of PR. |
| `snprintf` formatting | Same as above. | Rejection of PR. |
| Flash `erase` | Takes hundreds of milliseconds, blocks the system. | Rejection of PR; only allowed in non-hot paths for Capsule commit. |
| Flash `write` | Same as above; only allowed for Capsule commit. | Rejection of PR. |
| Blocking for backend ready | Backend should return `-EAGAIN` when busy; Core updates drop counter. | Rejection of PR. |
| Copying large data in loops | Must use fixed frame lengths; complete in a single critical section. | Rejection of PR. |
| Floating point (Hot path) | Some MCUs lack FPU; software FP is extremely slow. | `_Generic` allowed for `float`, but use `memcpy` for bitwise copy during encoding. |
| String compare/search | Runtime string parsing is prohibited. | Rejection of PR. |

**Allowed Items**:
- Fixed maximum length frame encoding (assembled on stack, no dynamic allocation).
- Writing to RAM Ring (single critical section).
- Updating global drop counter (`volatile uint32_t` increment).
- Lightweight timestamp (reading 32-bit counter or delta encoding).
- CRC-16 lookup table (256B ROM table, single loop).
- `_Generic` type dispatch (compile-time resolution, zero runtime overhead).

## 3. Storage Rules

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Default RAM Ring | All events enter RAM Ring first; this is the only hot path storage. |
| Flash Disabled by Default | Flash writing must not be enabled by default. |
| Flash for Fault Capsule Only | **Never** write to Flash during normal operation. Commit to Flash only after a fault, called from user code in a non-ISR context via `axiom_capsule_commit()`. |
| Explicit Persistence | If general events need Flash persistence, implement via a separate backend template with rate-limiting and wear-leveling strategies, outside the hot path. |
| Power-loss Recovery Test | Any backend involving Flash/FRAM/NVRAM must provide power-loss recovery test cases. |
| Wear Strategy Documentation | Flash backends must document erase/write estimates, wear-leveling strategies, and life expectancy. |

---

## 4. Protocol Rules

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Event Record is the Only Log Entity | No distinction between "text logs" and "binary logs" in firmware; only Event Records exist. |
| No Private Backend Protocols | All buffers received by backends must be unified Event Record frames. Backends handle transport adaptation (e.g., COBS, CAN-FD framing) but cannot change internal frame structure. |
| Text is Just Rendering | Text output is rendered by the host decoder using dictionary templates. |
| JSON is Just Export | JSON is converted from binary by host tools. |
| Binary is Storage/Transport Form | Binary frame is the only data form crossing the firmware-host boundary. |
| Self-describing Payload | Each payload field must have a type tag (`0x01=u8, 0x02=i8...`). Decoder parses structure without external schema; dictionary handles semantic mapping (ID → Name/Template). |
| Forward Compatibility | Minor version increments only append new type tags or flags; existing field semantics remain unchanged. Major version changes must synchronize decoder, golden frames, specs, and docs. |

---

## 5. Dropping Rules

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| DEBUG Dropping Allowed | DEBUG level events can be discarded when resources are tight. |
| Rate Limiting Allowed | Discard events when global or per-backend rate limits are exceeded. |
| Backend Busy Dropping | Discard when backend `ready()` is false or `write()` returns `-EAGAIN`. |
| **No Silent Dropping** | All drops must notify the backend via `on_drop` callback, and Core must increment the drop counter. |
| **Must Generate DROP_SUMMARY** | When recovering from a dropping state, Core must auto-generate an `AXIOM_LEVEL_WARN` `DROP_SUMMARY` event containing `lost_count`, `last_module_id`, and `last_event_id`. |
| Persistent Drop Stats | Drop counters must be saved with the capsule during Capsule commit for post-mortem analysis. |

---

## 6. Extensibility Rules

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Zero-Intrusive Backend Extension | New backends only need to implement `axiom_backend_t` and call `axiom_backend_register()`. No modification to `core/` or `frontend/` files. |
| Extensible Payload Types | Use `0x0A~0x7F` for new type tags. Must update encoder, decoder, spec, golden tests, and docs simultaneously. Decoders should skip unknown tags and mark as `UNKNOWN_TYPE` instead of crashing. |
| Prunable Profiles | `DEV` / `FIELD` / `PROD` profiles controlled by macros. New profiles added in `frontend/` must not alter existing profile semantics. |
| Weak Port Symbols | All port functions provide `__attribute__((weak))` defaults. New ports (e.g., new MCU series) only override necessary functions without modifying library code. |
| Extensible Toolchain | Decoder uses pluggable dictionary loading (JSON/YAML/X-Macro). New export formats (e.g., CSV, PCAP) implemented via new render modules. |
| API Stability | `AX_*` macros and `axiom_backend_t` struct ABI are locked from v1.0. Internal `_axiom_*` functions may change in minor versions. |

---

## 7. User Friendly Rules

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 5-Minute Start | New users can copy `axiomtrace.h` to their project, write 3 lines of code, and compile/log immediately. |
| Intuitive API Naming | Macro naming follows `AX_<LEVEL>(MOD, EVT, ...)` or `AX_LOG(msg)`. No obscure abbreviations. |
| Progressive Complexity | Layer 0 (Hardcoded ID) → Layer 1 (X-Macro) → Layer 2 (YAML + codegen). Users upgrade as needed without forced complexity. |
| Clear Error Messages | Compile-time errors must use `#error "AxiomTrace: xxx"` with clear English prompts. Runtime errors (e.g., ring full) exposed via `on_drop` callback; no silent failures. |
| Full Example Coverage | Every Frontend API, Backend Template, and Profile must have an independent, compilable example. |
| Synchronized Documentation | Any API change must update `spec/api_reference.md`. Any protocol change must update `spec/wire_format.md` and the decoder. |
| Automated Single-file Library | Provide `tool/scripts/amalgamate.py` to merge the library into `axiomtrace.h`. Amalgamated output must pass all host tests. |

---

## 8. Development Workflow (Mandatory)

Any new feature, bug fix, or protocol change must strictly follow this workflow:

```text
Issue Opened
    ↓
Design Note (State design decisions, impact, alternatives in the issue)
    ↓
Spec Update (Modify spec/*.md to explain new semantics)
    ↓
Golden Frame Update (Update golden/*.bin and expected.json if wire format changes)
    ↓
Implementation (Follow all RULES.md)
    ↓
Decoder Update (Update Python decoder if protocol or type tags change)
    ↓
Tests (C host unit tests + Python decoder regression tests)
    ↓
Benchmark (Confirm no hot path regression, record in benchmark report)
    ↓
Docs (Update README, api_reference.md, example comments)
    ↓
Changelog (Record in "Keep a Changelog" format)
    ↓
PR Review (At least 1 reviewer, check against RULES.md)
    ↓
Merge
```

**Skipping any step = Rejection of PR.**

## 9. Maintenance Workflow

### 9.1 Daily Maintenance

- **Iteration Start**: Check `ROUTE.md` goals, ensure no scope creep.
- **Each Commit**: Run `ctest` (host tests) locally before pushing.
- **Protocol Tweaks**: Run `tool/golden/update_golden.py` and commit new golden frames.
- **Weekly**: Check `tests/` coverage; add tests for any uncovered new code.

### 9.2 Release Workflow

1. Confirm all `ROUTE.md` tasks for the stage are complete.
2. Run full tests: `ctest --output-on-failure` + `python tool/tests/test_decoder.py`.
3. Run benchmark: `tool/benchmark/host_benchmark` and update the report.
4. Check for no P0/P1 issues (see §10).
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
6. Update `PLAN.md` status.
7. Tag git: `git tag v0.x-stage`.
8. Run amalgamation script and verify the single-file library passes tests.
9. Publish Release Note (including binaries, single-file library, decoder, and docs).

### 9.3 Issue Grading and Response

| Grade | Definition | Response Time | Handling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0** | Data loss, silent drop, protocol incompatibility, build failure. | 24h | Fix immediately, block release. |
| **P1** | Performance regression > 20%, API/doc mismatch, backend leak. | 72h | Must fix, delay release. |
| **P2** | Doc error, example build failure, non-core defect. | 1 week | Schedule fix. |
| **P3** | Code style, optimization suggestion, enhancement request. | Variable | Decide after discussion. |

## 12. Architectural Compliance Checklist

Authors must self-assess this checklist before submitting new code:

- [ ] All features fit into one of: `LOG / EVT / PROBE / FAULT / BACKEND / TOOL`.
- [ ] No stray modules (new .c/.h must belong to one of the five planes).
- [ ] No dual protocols (no private backend protocols).
- [ ] No RTOS/Linux implementation branches (port layer isolation, core has no OS dependency).
- [ ] Hot path has no malloc, no printf, no Flash erase, no blocking.
- [ ] New backend did not modify core code.
- [ ] New type tags synchronized with decoder and spec.
- [ ] New APIs synchronized with docs, examples, and tests.
- [ ] No silent dropping (drop counter + `DROP_SUMMARY` present).
- [ ] Examples compile independently (no reliance on undocumented internal symbols).

**Incomplete Checklist = PR Rejection.**
