# AxiomTrace v1.0 — Industrial Observability Microkernel

AxiomTrace is a high-performance, deterministic observability core designed for bare-metal MCU environments. It transforms the way embedded logs are handled by pushing complexity to the host and keeping the firmware hot path pure, fast, and O(1).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```c
#include "axiomtrace.h"

int main(void) {
    axiom_init();
    /* Structured event: O(1), ISR-safe, 0-malloc, 0-printf */
    AX_EVT(INFO, MOTOR, START, (uint16_t)3200); 
    return 0;
}
```

## 💎 The Industrial Pillars

### ⚡ Deterministic O(1) Performance
AxiomTrace guarantees that every log call executes in constant time. By using a **Blind Overwrite** policy and a bitwise-mask ring buffer, it avoids expensive frame boundary searches during interrupts.

### 🧬 Direct-to-Ring (D2R) Technology
Unlike traditional loggers that assemble frames on the stack, AxiomTrace writes data **directly into the ring buffer segments**. Coupled with **Incremental CRC**, it eliminates redundant memory copies and massive stack frame allocations.

### 🌐 Dual-Track Time Synchronization
Supports high-resolution relative counters for precise timing analysis, while allowing periodic Unix timestamp injection for real-world wall-clock alignment on the host side.

### 🎨 Rich Host-side Semantics
Keep your firmware binary lean by storing only raw IDs and integers. Use the **Host Dictionary** to map IDs back to human-readable text, enums, physical units, and rich metadata.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Protocol-Entity Architecture**: Text/JSON/Binary are just views; the Event Record is the only truth.
- **Pluggable Backends**: UART, USB, RTT, SWO, or Flash Capsule — add new ones without touching the core.
- **Fault Capsule**: Automatically freezes pre/post windows during critical faults and commits to non-volatile storage.
- **Profile-based Pruning**: `PROD` profile automatically removes debug probes and logs at compile-time.
- **Bilingual Documentation**: Seamless transition between English and 简体中文 for global collaboration.
